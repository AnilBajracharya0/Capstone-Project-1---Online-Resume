    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>

    <p>Here are some of my favorite hobbies:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Traveling</li>
      <li>Photography</li>
      <li>Muay Thai Training</li>
      <li>Web Development</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Traveling opens my mind to new experiences, which I capture through
      Photography. Muay Thai keeps me disciplined and fit, while Web Development
      lets me express my creativity. These hobbies motivate and inspire me,
      adding depth and purpose to my life.
